# rover-ros2
Submodule which includes all ros2 packages for the rover. These are centrally located for modular rover operation. You can use launch files located here to run any module as standalone or as a full-rover relay.

## Software Pre-reqs


The BaseStation computer will need several things.

- ROS2 Humble

- Follow the standard ROS2 humble install process. Linux recommended.

- https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

- Colcon

- `$ sudo apt update`

- `$ sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions`

- Configured Static IP for Ubiquiti bullet

- This process will depend on the system, but you'll need this for using the Ubiquiti network with the M2 bullets.

- Settings:

- Net Mask: 255.255.255.0

- IP Address: 192.168.1.x

- This can be just about anything, just not ending in 1.20, 1.21, 1.69, or 1.0

- Gateway: 192.168.1.0
  

## Headless Control

  To control the rover without a base station you'll need to run the headless control node. 
  
- SSH to the the rover from a computer computer over wifi (or connect directly)

- `ssh clucky@192.168.1.69`

- Password: spaceiscool639

- Run `Ros2 run headless_pkg headless`
	- This needs to be done in a separate ssh/shell window from the core rover node

  

## Running the Rover node
  

- Ensure you're either connected directly to the rover's network switch over ethernet or connected to an M2 bullet which has connection to the rover (red signal lights on)

- SSH to the the rover from a computer computer over wifi (or connect directly)

- `ssh clucky@192.168.1.69`

- Password: spaceiscool639

- run `ros2 run core_control_pkg core_control`
	- This needs to be done in a separate ssh/shell window from the headless control node (if you're running it)

- You should see "MCU found" on a serial line

- If not, you'll get an error it's not found and the program will close. Ensure the teensy is connected via usb to the Nuc

  

## Connecting the GuliKit Controller (Recommended)

  

- Connect controller to pc with USB-C

- Select the "X-Input" control mode (Windows logo) on the controller.

- Hold the button next to the symbols (windows, android, switch, etc...)

- You'll need to release the button and press down again to cycle to the next mode
